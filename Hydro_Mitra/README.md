## 🔑 **Project Components** 🔑

### 1. **Backend (Node.js + Express)** ⚙️

#### MongoDB Cloud Integration 💾:
   - The **MongoDB Cloud** database stores all data securely, including sensor data, test results, and microplastic contamination insights.
   - A scalable solution for efficient data storage and management.

#### API Endpoints (Node.js + Express) 📡:
   - Created custom **RESTful APIs** to handle data fetching, posting, and real-time updates. 
   - APIs allow seamless communication between the **ESP32 hardware unit** and the server, enabling the collection of real-time data from water bodies.
   - APIs also manage the storage and retrieval of data for graph generation and static data requests.

#### Machine Learning Integration (Flask + YOLO) 🤖:
   - Used **YOLO-based machine learning** models to detect microplastic algae contamination in water bodies from camera footage.
   - A **Flask server** is used to serve the YOLO model, with API endpoints allowing users to send images for analysis.

### 2. **Machine Learning (YOLO + Flask Server)** 🤖
   - 🌊 **YOLO** is used to detect **microplastic algae contamination** in water bodies via camera images. 
   - 🔍A **Flask server** exposes APIs for model interaction, processing images to detect contaminants. 

### 3. **Hardware (ESP32 + Sensors + Camera)** 📡
   - 🌡️💧 **ESP32** collects data from **temperature**, **turbidity**, **TDS**, and other sensors. 
   -  **Camera** captures live footage, processed by the YOLO model for contamination detection. 
   - 🎥 Data from the sensors and camera is sent to the server for analysis. 💬

### 4. **Frontend (React Dashboard)** 💻
   - 📊 **React-based frontend** displays real-time data and test results, offering a **user-friendly** interface. 
   - 🚨 Visual insights on **water quality** and **contamination status** to help users make informed decisions.

## 🔄 **How it Works** 🔄

1. **Data Collection:** The **ESP32** collects data from sensors and the camera feed, which is sent to the server via APIs. 🌍
2. **Real-Time Processing:** The server processes the data, running the **YOLO model** to detect contamination. ⚡
3. **Data Storage:** Collected data is securely stored in **MongoDB Cloud** for analysis and reporting. 💾
4. **Live Dashboard:** The **React frontend** fetches and displays real-time data, showing water quality metrics and **microplastic contamination** results on the dashboard. 📲
